## Taxi Fare Prediction using Machine Learning Models
Developed predictive models using Gradient Boosting and Linear Regression to estimate NYC taxi fares, achieving an RÂ² of 0.71 and RMSE of $6.66. Applied exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, geospatial, and time series analysis to identify key factors influencing fares such as pickup location, trip distance, and time of day.

Engineered features to enhance model performance and evaluated results using cross-validation and error metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE).
